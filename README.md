## Description
These are some simple Solidity smart contracts that I code to learn.

## Usage
Copy the code into the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and deploy it using the JavaScript virtual machine (*Run > Environmet > JavaScript VM*).

## Disclamer
Use for learning purposes only. They work but I cannot garantee they are bug free.
